Welcome to Programming Concepts with JavaScript! April 29,2025

Install node js!

node --version... v22.11.0.... (no problem if you any other version)

What is node js?

"Runtime environment", that allows JavaScript to run 
                                i) In our machine ( our console)
                                ii) On Server (??)


 Client/ Server? 
    JS when it was developed .. was ONLY for Client Side scriptings!(Only for Web Development)
    node js... enabled JS to run for Server Side Scripts also (web development)

    node js .. enabled JS to run on our machines( console based applications!) (calculator make it in JS.. node js will support you..)

node js will PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN DEVELOPING REACT APPLICATION... :)
